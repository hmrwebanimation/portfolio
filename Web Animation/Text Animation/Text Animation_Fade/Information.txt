Hi there,
we would like to have a simple CSS animation of a count down.
So first the 3 appears while becoming smaller and fading away, 
then the 2 appears while becoming a bit smaller and fading away and the same for 1.
That's it. After the 1 it is over. It should take exactly 2 seconds 
from when the 3 appears until the 1 disappears. Al that just with CSS and HTML. 
Please, no Javascript. The number could start with a height of 250px. 
The font is not so important.
Can you do this?

Just for your information, we will display this centered (horizontal & vertical) on top of an 
HTML page as a countdown before a screen-recording starts.

Sorry It should take exactly 3 seconds I ment
